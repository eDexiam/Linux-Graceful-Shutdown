# Linux Graceful Program Shutdown _thing_
Or as I call it "Please don't let me write UI code again"


This is still a WIP it adds the Windows like prompt of shutting down (asking programs to close) before shutting down.
Originally this is just meant to solve a personal problem of mine but I decided to share because why not, this is unfinished so it won't even work and the code also probably very bad.

Have fun.
